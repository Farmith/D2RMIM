## Preparation:
~~If you have never used the accompanying handle64.exe you need to manually run that executable once, and accept the terms of use for it before beginning.~~
No unneccessary preparations needed, maybe a soft drink and a sandwich?

## Tutorial:

For each account you wish to use, perform the following steps:
	
	1. Click "Add Account" button 

	2. Your battle net launcher will boot, log in with your credentials.

	3. Press "Play Game" button in the launcher

	4. Wait (and click frenetically as we all do) untill you are connected to your online account and can see your characters

	5. Close the game (The battle.net launcher will already have closed automatically)

Once you have added all your accounts (They will be visible in the 'Accounts:' list view) you can check one or several of these accounts that you wish to launch,
launch them with the "Launch" button.

They will now login, one after the other by using hidden one-time keys which you generated while doing the "Add Account"-part.

### Note: The one-time keys do not last forever, occasionally you will get "Could not connect to Server", in which case you need to mark the affected account(s) and press "Refresh" which sets up new one-time keys by a similar procedure to the initial setup.


Enjoy!




FAQ:
	
	* What does the "Dump RegKey" button do?
		A) it dumps (duh) the current token the gameclient has stored into dump.bin, this can be used as a backup-way of 
			accessing the launch procedure, should the automatic way fail. The way you do it in this special case is:
			1. Login to the game normally through battle.net launcher (without using this tool)
			2. Start the game with the proper button
			3. Wait untill you are logged into character-select in the game client
			4. Press "Dump RegKey"
			5. Rename dump.bin to a name you prefer for this particular account and start D2RMIM, you can now press Launch with the proper name.
			
	* Does this application save my username/password in any way?
		- A) Not unless someone else added something to it that wasn't there originally

	* How does this app work?
		- A) It uses one-time hashes/keys stored by the D2R client to authenticate just like it normally does

	* It doesnt work! (More of a statement than a question tbh)
		- A) Your one-time keys may be outdated, if you launch battle.net normally and login to your account, you will need to refresh the tokens for the account 
				once you want to multi-box again. use the "Refresh" button after selecting affected account(s).
		  A) Run the program as administrator, maybe that helps
		  A) What a pity..





## Version log:

* 1.4.2
	-	Feature release, added global hotkeys (which can be disabled in the .config file) per default: numlock enabled -> numpad 0 = first client, numpad 1 = 2nd client, numpad 2 = third client
	-	Check the changes in MultiInstanceManager.config for adding less/more hotkeys, setting them to enabled="false" disables them and enabled="true" enables them.

* 1.4.1
	-	Minor bugfix release, removed a bug from the "Add Account" button

* 1.4
	-	Added functionality to allow command-line arguments to the clients.

* 1.3
	-	Removed dependency for Handle64.exe

* 1.2 
	- 	Buggfix sorting "Setting up several accounts in one flow", saving the tokens in a more reliable fashion.

* 1.1
	-	 General Bugfixes and attempts at bugfixes

* 1.0

	- 	First "official" release of D2RMIM, sort-of works at this point, sometimes.

Note: When first launching D2RMIM and going through setup, don't be alarmed if the game client + bnet launcher exit out once setup, just press "Launch" if you just with to use 1 single account.

The closing of bnet + client is to allow multiple accounts to be setup easily without manually closing stuff down, when using "Launch" stuff doesn't get closed down arbitrarily.

Note: There is a "Dump RegKey" button still on the gui in this release, this is mostly for debug-purposes tho so don't worry about it, all it does is dump the web-keys for D2R into "dump.bin", nothing more nothing less.

## TODO:

*	Add more configuration options
*	Find a faster way to "refresh" accounts
