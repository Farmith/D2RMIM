# Contributing

Feel free to fork this project, and create pull requests however, I ask that you keep a few things in mind:

1.  Keep the pull requests small, only request pull requests on a small-fix or single-function basis, large pull requests with several files and a hodgepodge of code changes will be ignored.
2.  Try to fill up if there are any issues reported by other users 
3.  Would appreciate if you communicate with me before doing larger work so that we arent by any chance spending time doing the same work twice.
